  "body": "### What is an Api Proxy\r\nAPI Proxy act as a middleware for your API's, enabling a centralized authorization mechanism and hiding the complexity of your API's for its clients. As the name suggests, it's only a Proxy, different from an API Gateway (that can orchestrate api's and etc) the proxy should only apply validations (such security validations), caching, etc, and forward the requests/responses.\r\n\r\n### Why another Api Proxy?\r\nThere is currently many implementations for Api Proxy, but many of them are either based on blocking architecture (threads and Blocking IO) or not open-source projects. That's why an Api Proxy implementation using Vert.x comes in hand.\r\n\r\n### Why Vert.x?\r\nVert.x is a lightweight library to build reactive applications, it's based on Netty and has an awesome community and great projects based on it. It scale very well for IO because of its non-blocking nature and has many other cool features that can be checked out at its [docs](http://vertx.io/docs/).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
